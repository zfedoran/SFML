/// \class sf::StencilMode
/// \ingroup graphics
///
/// sf::StencilMode is a class that controls stencil testing.
///
/// In addition to drawing to the visible portion of a render target,
/// there is the possibility to "draw" to a so-called stencil buffer.
/// The stencil buffer is a special non-visible buffer that can contain
/// a single value per pixel that is drawn. This can be thought of as a
/// fifth value in addition to red, green, blue and alpha values. The maximum
/// value that can be represented depends on what is supported by the system.
/// Typically support for a 8-bit stencil buffer should always be available.
/// This will also have to be requested when creating a render target via
/// the sf::ContextSettings that is passed during creation. Stencil testing
/// will not work if there is no stencil buffer available in the target
/// that is being drawn to.
///
/// Initially, just like with the visible color buffer, the stencil value of
/// each pixel is set to an undefined value. Calling sf::RenderTarget::clear
/// will set each pixel's stencil value to 0. sf::RenderTarget::clear can be
/// called at any time to reset the stencil values back to 0.
///
/// When drawing an object, before each pixel of the color buffer is updated
/// with its new color value, the stencil test is performed. During this test
/// 2 values are compared with each other: the reference value that is passed
/// via sf::StencilMode and the value that is currently in the stencil buffer.
/// The arithmetic comparison that is performed on the 2 values can also be
/// controlled via sf::StencilMode. Depending on whether the test passes i.e.
/// the comparison yields true, the color buffer is updated with its new RGBA
/// value and if set in sf::StencilMode the stencil buffer is updated
/// accordingly. The new stencil value will be used during stencil testing the
/// next time the pixel is drawn to.
///
/// The class is composed of 4 components, each of which has its
/// own public member variable:
/// \li Stencil Comparison (@ref stencilComparison)
/// \li Stencil Update Operation (@ref stencilUpdateOperation)
/// \li Stencil Reference Value (@ref stencilReference)
/// \li Stencil Mask Value (@ref stencilMask)
/// \li Stencil Only Update (@ref stencilOnly)
///
/// The stencil comparison specifies the comparison that is performed between
/// the reference value of the currently active sf::StencilMode and the value
/// that is currently in the stencil buffer. This comparison determines whether
/// the stencil test passes or fails.
///
/// The stencil update operation specifies how the stencil buffer is updated if
/// the stencil test passes. If the stencil test fails, neither the color or
/// stencil buffers will be modified. If incrementing or decrementing the
/// stencil value the new value will be clamped to the range from 0 to the
/// maximum representable value given the bit width of the stencil buffer
/// e.g. 255 if an 8-bit stencil buffer is being used.
///
/// The reference value is used both during the comparison with the current
/// stencil buffer value and as the new value to be written when the operation
/// is set to Replace.
///
/// The mask value is used to mask the bits of both the reference value and
/// the value in the stencil buffer during the comparison and when updatinig.
/// The mask can be used to e.g. segment the stencil value bits into separate
/// regions that are used for different purposes.
///
/// In certain situations, it might make sense to only write to the stencil
/// buffer and not the color buffer during a draw. The written stencil buffer
/// value can then be used in subsequent draws as a masking region.
///
/// In SFML, a stencil mode can be specified every time you draw a sf::Drawable
/// object to a render target. It is part of the sf::RenderStates compound
/// that is passed to the member function sf::RenderTarget::draw().
///
/// \see sf::RenderStates, sf::RenderTarget
